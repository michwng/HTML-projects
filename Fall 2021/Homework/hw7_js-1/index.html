        <h2>Highwayman</h2>
        <p>
            A highwayman was a robber who stole from travellers. This type of thief usually travelled and robbed by horse as compared to a footpad who travelled and robbed on foot; mounted highwaymen were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads. Such criminals operated in Great Britain from the Elizabethan era until the early 19th century. In many other countries, they persisted for a few decades longer, until the mid or late 19th century. Highwaywomen, such as Katherine Ferrers, were said to also exist, often dressing as men, especially in fiction.

              As I was going over the far famed Kerry mountains<br>
              I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was counting.<br>
              I first produced my pistol,and then produced my rapier.<br>
              Said stand and deliver, for he were a bold deceiver,
          </p>
          <p>
              Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
              Whack for my daddy-o<br>
              Whack for my daddy-o<br>
              There's whiskey in the jar
          </p>
          <p>
              I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.<br>
              I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny.<br>
              She said and she swore, that she never would deceive me,<br>
              but the devil take the women, for they never can be easy
          </p>
          <p>
              I went into my chamber, all for to take a slumber,<br>
              I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.<br>
              But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,<br>
              Then sent for Captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.
          </p>
          <p>
              <img class='image-right' src='media/highway2.jpg' alt='another highwayman'>
              It was early in the morning, just before I rose up for travel,<br>
              The guards were all around me and likewise Captain Farrel.<br>
              I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,<br>
              But I couldnâ€™t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken.
          </p>
          <p>
              Now there's some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'<br>
              And others take delight in the hurling and the bowling<br>
              But I take delight in the juice of the barley<br>
              And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
          </p>
          <p>
              If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army<br>
              If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney<br>
              And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny<br>
              And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
