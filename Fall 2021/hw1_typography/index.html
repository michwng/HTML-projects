                    By now, we should have a good appreciation of the importance of typography in design. Up to this point, we've just used Google Fonts to link to open-source fonts to use with our sites

            </div>
            <div class='col-6'>
                <h2>Other Options</h2>
                <p>
                    We can, however, use a different approach. Remember, if a font family isn't installed on the client's computer, it can't load when the page does. So we can instead provide a font to the client that will load when the page does

                <h2>Important Note</h2>
                <p>
                    Fonts are subject to copyright law. So it is important, if you want to use a custom font, that you make sure that the font you choose is open-source

                <h2>Basic Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    So, once you've found a suitable font and downloaded it, you can use the steps that we'll outline in this to add the font(s) to your site
