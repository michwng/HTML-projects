                    <h2>What is a framework?</h2>
                    <p>    
                        A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.

                        The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided

                    <h2>Prepackaged</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Common Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most websites share a very similar (not to say identical) structure. The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. In this way, frameworks allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time. To summarize: there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

                        Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.

                        Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as <span style='font-style:italic'>Twitter Blueprint</span>. A few months into development, Twitter held its <a href='https://blog.twitter.com/2010/hack-week' target="_blank"> first Hack Week</a> and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.<br> <span style='display:block; text-align:right'>Source: <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/about/' target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a></span>
