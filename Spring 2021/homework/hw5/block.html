        <p>
            Block-Level elements are the big boys of the code. In other words, there can be in-line and block elements inside a block-level element. Yes, you heard me right. There can be a Block-Level Element <strong>inside</strong> another Block-Level Element. 
        </p>
        <h3>Here are a few Block-Level tags used in HTML.</h3>

            Again, these tags are <strong>big boi</strong> tags. Thus, they are called block-level elements. You won't be able to find a tag with a higher level than this. They can hold other block-level elements inside them, as well as in-line elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>  
        <p>
            Block-level is only used to describe an element in HTML (that's what I believe). It does not have different connotations like the In-Line does. Therefore, it's safe to think of "element" everytime you hear block-level. <br>

        <h3>Here is an example.</h3>

            Focus on the left side. Notice that the texts are in separate lines. They align to be in the shape of a 'block', thus, granting it the name block-level element.  Once again, these elements would be like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;. <br> <br>
            This is not mentioned in the in-line slide, but notice how the in-line elements are in one line. It is given the name 'in-line' because of this. An example of an in-line element is &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;.
