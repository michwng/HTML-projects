        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a programming language developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. It is used to create webpages and is often paired with CSS and Javascript to create remarkable webpages. HTML is regulated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the most recent standard of HTML is HTML5.

        <h3>Here are a few tags used in HTML.</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <!-- &lt; is <, &gt; is >. -->
            <li>&lt;html&gt;  and  &lt;/html&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt;  and  &lt;/head&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;body&gt;  and  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;p&gt;  and  &lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;article&gt;  and  &lt;/article&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            HTML Tags, most of the time, consist of an opening and closing tag. In the case of &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;, &lt;html&gt; is the opening tag and &lt;/html&gt; is the closing tag. However, if you put this, some elements, and text without CSS, it will look bland on the webpage. With CSS, you can make the website even more visually appealing!

            Although programming can be fun, it is, a lot of times, difficult for the programmer to debug or identify an error in a piece of code. But, with its flaws, come strengths. <br>
            Some games are made in HTML5. Although HTML5 does not have many notable games, it's slowly overcoming the recent cutoff of Adobe Flash Player. <br>Hopefully, all flash games that are no longer playable will be converted into HTML5 (It is playable with Supernova or other .swf players, but the quality and performance are not as great).
