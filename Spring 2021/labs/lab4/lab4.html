		<p>
			I am from Kingsport, Tennessee and have lived there all my life. It houses a super friendly suburban community, as well as many elementary schools and 2 middle schools and high schools. I graduated from Dobyns-Bennett high School in the late summer of 2020. Dobyns-Bennett has also been a particularly prestigious High School, being named one of the best high schools in Tennessee. Kingsport is also reknowned for being the headquarters for Pal's and Eastman Chemical Company.

			I am currently majoring in Computing in the IT Concentration. Although I do not know my current class standing, my class standing in Dobyns-Bennett (High School) was about 112 out of 542. I hope to pursue an IT degree and seeing if a teaching degree is within the reigns of this concentration.
